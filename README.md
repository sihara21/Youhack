# YouTube Subscription Form

This project provides a basic subscription form for users to subscribe to your YouTube channel.

## Features

- Allows users to enter their email address to subscribe.
- Redirects users to the YouTube subscription page for your channel.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Customize the form with your YouTube channel ID in `index.html`.
3. Style the form by modifying `style.css` if needed.
4. Add any additional functionality or validation in `script.js`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser

### Installation
To set up a YouTube subscription form with Firebase, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - If you have a specific repository or project in mind, you can clone it to your local machine using Git. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sihara21/Youhack.git
   ```

   Replace `https://github.com/username/repository.git` with the actual URL of your repository.

2. **Set Up Firebase Project:**
   - If you haven't already, create a Firebase project on the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/). Follow the prompts to set up your project.

3. **Initialize Firebase in Your Project:**
   - Install the Firebase CLI if you haven't already by running:

   ```
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

   - Log in to Firebase by running:

   ```
   firebase login
   ```

   - Navigate to your project directory and run:

   ```
   firebase init
   ```

   - Select the Firebase services you want to set up (in this case, you'll need Firestore for database and Hosting to deploy your app).

4. **Modify Your Code:**
   - In your project directory, open your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to integrate your YouTube subscription form.

   - Add Firebase SDK to your HTML file. You can find the SDK configuration in your Firebase project settings.

5. **Implement Firebase Authentication (Optional):**
   - If you want to handle user authentication, you can use Firebase Authentication. Set it up and integrate it into your app.

6. **Deploy Your App:**
   - Once your project is set up, you can deploy it to Firebase Hosting using:

   ```
   firebase deploy
   ```

   - Your app will be hosted on a Firebase domain (e.g., `https://your-project-id.web.app`).

7. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in Firebase Hosting settings.

Remember to replace placeholders like `username/repository.git` and `https://your-project-id.web.app` with your actual repository and project URLs.

Please note that this is a general overview and the actual implementation might vary based on your specific requirements and technologies used. Be sure to consult Firebase and the specific technologies you're using for detailed documentation and best practices.
No installation is required for this project.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your email address in the provided field.
3. Click the "Subscribe" button.
4. The browser will open a new tab to the YouTube subscription page for your channel.
